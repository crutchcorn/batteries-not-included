These packages are meant for non-framework based code. This means that every utility in this subpackage should be able to be used
in vanilla JS or in codebases utilizing something like React or Angular.

  * [Wrap Number](#wrap-number)

------

### Normalize Number

| File               | Function           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `normalize-number` | `normalizeNumber`  |

As a result, you're able to import either from:
```javascript
import {normalizeNumber} from 'batteries-not-included/utils';
import {normalizeNumber} from 'batteries-not-included/utils/normalize-number';
```

However, due to potential breaking APIs in the future, it is highly suggested to use the first of the two results.

The function takes three parameters:

1) The number to check the value of
2) The minimum value that the number must be
3) The maximum value that the number must be

All three of these parameters must be numbers

If the number is less than the minimum, the minimum number will be returned
If the number is more than the maximum, the maximum number will be returned

#### Examples
```javascript
normalizeNumber(5, 3, 10); // 5
normalizeNumber(1, 3, 10); // 3
normalizeNumber(18, 3, 10); // 10
```

### Wrap Number

| File               | Function           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `wrap-number` | `wrapNumber`  |

As a result, you're able to import either from:
```javascript
import {wrapNumber} from 'batteries-not-included/utils';
import {wrapNumber} from 'batteries-not-included/utils/wrap-number';
```

If the number is more than the maximum, the minimum number will be returned

#### Examples

wrapNumber(1, 3, 10); // 10
wrapNumber(18, 3, 10); // 3
```


### Make an ASCII Table From 2D Array

| File      | Function   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| `tablize` | `tablize`  |

This function takes a two-dimentional array and treats it as a table,
so it outputs to a string that's an ASCII art of a table. It will
treat the first item in the array as a header to said table

For example, given:
```javascript
const tableArray = [
    ["Item", "Count", "Another count"],
    ["Apples", 3, 1939889988],
    ["Oranges", 399, 213],
    ["Bananas", 1, -129389176]
];

console.log(tablize(tableArray));
```

It will output the following ASCII art:

```
Item    | Count | Another count
-------------------------------
Apples  |     3 |    1939889988
Oranges |   399 |           213
Bananas |     1 |    -129389176
```

> when printed out. This is meant only as a demo for some small things
> that are not meant to be public.
> Also, if you use this for outputting data in Node, you may be better suited
> by `console.table`, as in some circumstances it is interactive
