# React Utils

As many of these packages are hooks, these packages expect a peer dependency of at least React 16.9.

There are various sub-utilities to the React section of this package:

- [A11Y helper utilities](/react/accessibility)
- [Generic data table](/react/table)
- [Event listeners outside a specific element](/react/outside-events)

It is suggested that all of these modules are imported from the following:

```tsx
import { functionName } from "batteries-not-included/react";
```
